# Project Title

Getting Started with Solidity.

## Description

This is a simple ERC-20 token contract written in Solidity, created as part of the MetaCrafters assessment for the "Getting Started with Solidity" module. This contract demonstrates basic Solidity concepts, including variables, data types, functions, and control structures. The contract includes the following functions:
1. Mint - increases the total supply and balance of the specified address.
2. Burn - decreases the total suppy and balance of the specified address.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. Follow these steps:

### Installing

To get stated with the project, you'll need too have Remix open it is a web-based Solidity IDE that allows the user to write, deploy, andd test smart contracts.
- Open Remix in your web browser: https://remix.ethereum.org/
- Create a new Solidity file by clicking on the "Create" button.
- Copy and paste the contract code into the new file.

Instead of copying and pasting the contract code, you can also import it directly.
- Download the file and click "Open a File from your File System" to import the contract code into Remix.
  
Once you've importeed the contract code, you can proceed with compiling and deploying the contract.

### Executing program

To deploy and interact with the contract, follow these steps:

1. Compile the contract by clicking on the "Compile" button in the Remix Solidity compiler.
2. Deploying the contract to the Remix VM by clicking on the "Deploy" button.
3. Interact with the contract using the Remix console.
